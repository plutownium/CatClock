# CatClock
a recreation of the LOLCATS clock I found here: https://codepen.io/codifiedconcepts/pen/bwgxRq

<h1>A Portfolio Project</h1>
Developed in two days after I found the original LOLCATS clock on CodePen, it is an original <strong>recreation</strong> of the app -- not a copy.

Meaning, I built it myself from the ground up. No peeking at their code!

<h4>You can visit the page here: https://plutownium.github.io/CatClock/</h4> 

The app still has a bug or two, but as it is right now, you can...

<ul>
<li>Set a wake up time</li>
<li>Set a lunch time</li>
<li>Set a nap time</li>
</ul>

...and have them all alerted to you via a change in the image and text display!

Not bad for only 148 lines of JavaScript.

P.S. If anyone knows why GitHub refuses to show the main image, I'd love to know.
